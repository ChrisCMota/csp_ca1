                    or the smutty rosella, is a

                    described by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820, and two subspecies are recognised. The species is
                    unusually coloured for a rosella, with a dark head and neck with pale cheeks—predominantly white in
                    the

                    subspecies from the Northern Territory and blue in the Western Australian subspecies hillii. The

                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terms_used_in_bird_topography">scapulars</a> are

                    are pale
                    yellow with fine black scallops. The long tail is blue-green, and the wings are black and
                    blue-violet.
                    The sexes
                    have similar plumage, while females and younger birds are generally duller with occasional spots of
                    red.

                    country, the northern rosella is predominantly herbivorous, consuming
                    seeds,
                    particularly of grasses and eucalypts, as well as flowers and berries, but it may also eat insects.
                    Nesting
                    takes place in tree hollows. Although uncommon, the northern rosella is rated as least concern on

            <h2>Taxonomy and naming</h2>
            <hr>
            <p id="2"> northern rosella was first described as Psittacus venustus by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in
                1820.
                <sup>[2]</sup> The
                description was based on an illustration by Ferdinand Bauer from a specimen collected by Robert Brown in
                February 1803, during Matthew Flinders' voyage around the Australian coastline.<sup>[3]</sup> The
                specific
                epithet is
                derived from the Latin venustus, meaning "charming, lovely or graceful".<sup>[4]</sup> Dutch zoologist
                Coenraad
                Jacob
                Temminck published the name Psittacus brownii in honour of Brown in 1821,<sup>[5]</sup> and Irish
                zoologist
                Nicholas
                Aylward Vigors transferred it (as P. brownii) to the genus Platycercus in 1827, describing it as the
                "most
                beautiful of the family".<sup>[6]</sup> However, John Gould wrote in his 1865 work Handbook to the Birds
                of
                Australia that
                "Hitherto this bird has been known to ornithologists as Platycercus brownii, a specific appellation in
                honour of
                the celebrated botanist; but which, I regret to say, must give place to the prior one of
                venustus."<sup>[7]</sup>

            <p>Gregory Mathews described the subspecies P. venustus hillii in 1910, collected by G.F. Hill from Napier
                Broome
                Bay in Western Australia. He noted that its cheeks had more blue and less white than the nominate
                subspecies.<sup>[8]</sup>
                The Victoria River marks the border between this and the nominate subspecies.<sup>[9]</sup> Animal
                taxonomist
                Arthur Cain
                treated the subspecies as synonymous to the nominate, as the only difference of which he knew was the
                colour of
                the cheeks, but conceded further evidence could prove them distinct.<sup>[10]</sup> As well as the
                differences
                in cheek
                plumage, the two differ in that subspecies hillii has brighter yellow feathers on the breast and belly
                with
                thinner black edges, and a consistently longer and wider bill.<sup>[9]</sup> A subspecies, P. venustus
                melvillensis from
                Melville Island, was described by Mathews in 1912, noting it to have blacker plumage on its
                back.<sup>[11]</sup>
                It is now
                thought to be indistinguishable from the nominate subspecies.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

            <p>"Northern rosella" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union
                (IOC).<sup>[12]</sup>
                Early names used include Brown's rosella, parrot or parakeet for its collector,<sup>[13]</sup> with
                Brown's
                parakeet
                remaining a name used in aviculture in Europe and the United Kingdom,<sup>[14]</sup> and smutty rosella,
                parrot
                or
                parakeet, from its dark plumage. Gould reported in 1848 that the latter was the local name used, and it
                was the
                most common name at the end of the 19th century. It was changed—possibly through bowdlerisation—to sooty
                parrot
                by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1913.<sup>[13]</sup> Bulawirdwird and
                Djaddokorddokord
                are two
                names from the Kunwinjku language of the western Arnhem Land.<sup>[15]</sup></p>

            <p>One of six species of rosella in the genus Platycercus, the northern rosella and related eastern (P.
                eximius) and
                pale-headed rosella (P. adscitus) make up a "white-cheeked" lineage. A 1987 genetic study on
                mitochondrial DNA
                by Ovenden and colleagues found that the northern rosella was the earliest offshoot (basal) of a lineage
                that
                gave rise to the other white-cheeked forms.<sup>[16]</sup> But a study with nuclear DNA by Ashlee
                Shipham and
                colleagues
                published in 2017 found that the eastern rosella was basal to the lineage that split into the
                pale-headed and
                northern rosellas, and hence, that non-sister taxa were able to hybridise among the
                rosellas.<sup>[17]</sup></p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <hr>
            <p id="3">Smaller than all rosella species except the western rosella, the adult northern rosella weighs 90
                to 110 g
                (3.2
                to 3.9 oz) and is 29 to 32 cm (11 to 13 in) long.[18]</sup> It has broad wings with a wingspan of around
                44 cm
                (17
                in),<sup>[9]</sup><sup>[18]</sup> and a long tail with twelve feathers.<sup>[9]</sup> The sexes are
                almost
                indistinguishable, though some adult
                females have duller plumage and are more likely to have some red feathers on the head and
                breast.<sup>[19]</sup>
                The adult
                bird has a black forehead, crown, lores, ear coverts, upper neck and nape, a whitish throat and large
                cheek-patches, which are mainly white with violet lower borders in the nominate
                subspecies,<sup>[20]</sup> and
                more blue
                with a narrow white upper segment in subspecies hillii. The feathers of the lower neck, mantle and
                scapulars are
                black narrowly fringed with yellow, giving a scalloped appearance, while the feathers of the back, rump,
                upper
                tail coverts and underparts are pale yellow with black borders and concealed grey bases. Those of the
                breast
                have very dark grey bases, occasionally tinged with red. The undertail covert feathers are red with
                black
                fringes. The feathers on the upper leg are pale yellow tinged with blue.<sup>[20]</sup> The central
                rectrices of
                the long
                tail are dark green changing to dark blue at the tips, while the other feathers are dark blue with two
                bands of
                pale blue and white tips. The undertail is pale blue with a white tip. The wings have a wide purplish
                blue
                shoulder patch at rest, with the secondary feathers edged darker blue and the primaries black edged with
                blue.
                The beak is off-white with a grey cere, the legs and feet are grey, and the iris is dark
                brown.<sup>[18]</sup>
                Immature
                birds resemble adults but are duller overall, with less-well defined cheek patches. The black plumage in
                particular is more greyish, and there are more likely to be scattered red feathers on the head, neck and
                underparts.<sup>[20]</sup></p>
